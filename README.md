qtrade tradebot



next steps:
- create a class to manage QuestTrade API requests
- other class to manage stocks: go through tracked stocks and check stop-loss, then update data in databases
- provide a user interface to be able to add tracked stocks, show stock charts, and set configurations such as emails to alert when stoploss is reached
- modify TokenManager to be more general: currently implements QuestTrade API logic
